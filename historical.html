                    <h2>Dataran Kubu Kuala Gel</h2> 
                    <p>One of the historical places in Kampung Melawi is Dataran Kubu Kuala Gel. After World War II, 
                    the British left behind this castle square at Kuala Gel, Melawi, Bachok. Back then, the fort's thickness 
                    allowed it to withstand mortar and small-arms fire. The fort's architectural structure occupies 8 square metres 
                    and rises to a height of 2.1 metres. The wall's full thickness is 30 centimetres of cement concrete. 
                    The British constructed Kelantan's Fort Square as a military preparation. On May 23, 2022, this square 
                    was officially inaugurated and made accessible to the public. These days, more people are visiting the 
                    area as a consequence of also beach.Due to the fort's convenient location close to the the coast, 
                    more people visit to the place so they may take in the beautiful scenery and historical significance. 
                    For those looking for something different, Fort Square in Kelantan is a must-visit location because of 
                    its natural beauty and rich history.</p>

                    <h2>The Goblin Castle(Istana Bunian)</h2> 
                    <p>Istana Bunian is a building built in the Melawi area. The palace's distinctive design attracts a lot of 
                    attention, and anybody who sees it is struck by how unique and mystical it looks. Hashim, a 66-year-old
                    resident, constructed this building. Even though it has been under construction since 1978, Hashim's residential 
                    structure, known as Istana Bunian, has generated a lot of attention in the community due to its distinctive 
                    and artistic design. This building was constructed with RM 1 million worth of basic resources, iron, stone, 
                    and cement. He claimed that in order to develop this structure, he was inspired by nature. 
                    Each and every element of Istana Bunian demonstrates Hashim's commitment to realising his vision and 
                    love of art. He is determined to create a masterpiece that will stand out in the neighbourhood even though 
                    there are obstacles in the way of finishing the construction.</p>

                    <h2>WW2 Pillbox</h2> 
                  
                    <p>One historical landmark in Bachok District, which is in the Kampung Melawi area, is the WW2 Pill Box. 
                        Despite being destroyed, Kelantan's British pillbox monument from World War II (1941) continues to draw 
                        tourists. Less impact on society, however, with the exception of a few veterans who were active. 
                        When Japan attacked the Malay Peninsula on December 8, 1941, this beach served as the first battleground. 
                        The British troops positioned on this beach have fiercely resisted the Japanese harm at preventing a landing. 
                        These days, both locals and visitors focus on this pill box as it has been transformed into a historical site.
                        Nevertheless, due to damage by waves and the passing of over a century, several pill boxes have vanished from 
                        the face of the surroundings. The remaining historical sites along the coastline are being preserved and 
                        protected, even though several pill boxes have vanished. Visitors from all over the world continue to 
                        honour and remember the tales of bravery and sacrifice from that terrible day.</p>
