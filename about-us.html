                    <h1>About Melawi</h1>
                    <p>According to the stories of the local elders here, the name Melawi originated from a warrior who possessed very high-level martial arts and spiritual knowledge. He was said to be of royal warrior descent and came from a region in Indonesia known as Kabupaten (District) Melawi. This district emerged from the confluence of three rivers: the Kayan River, the Melawi River, and the Pinoh River. There was a power struggle among the leaders there, as each was influenced by greed and the temptations of the Devil. However, this warrior did not want to get involved in the dispute and chose his own path, eventually arriving at a place now known as Melawi.</p>

The project manager of the 'ngesong bag,' Rozana Mat Radzi, 44, said the production began during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period, as they sought alternative income sources. The unique variation of Kelantan batik bags is a testament to the potential of handicraft products.</p>
